## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Please report security issues via one of the following channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred):
   Go to the repository -> Security tab -> "Report a vulnerability"
2. **Direct e-mail:** `security@oaslananka.dev`

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected versions
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (optional)

### Response SLA

- **Acknowledgement:** within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment:** within 5 business days
- **Fix or workaround:** within 30 days for critical issues

### Scope

This tool operates over SSH and handles credentials. The following are
**in scope** for security reports:

- Credential leakage in logs or error messages
- Command injection bypasses in `ensurePackage` or similar validators
- Session fixation or session hijacking via the session ID mechanism
- Rate limiter bypass allowing brute-force attacks
- Prototype pollution via JSON input parsing

Remote connector mode is a no-custody architecture. Users do not submit SSH
private keys, SSH passwords, root passwords, or cloud credentials to the hosted
control plane. Remote execution happens through an enrolled outbound agent that
keeps its private key locally, verifies signed control-plane action envelopes,
enforces local policy, and signs action results. See
[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the remote-agent threat model.

### Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report to their respective projects)
- Issues requiring physical access to the host running the MCP server
- Social engineering attacks
