# Security Model

`mcp-ssh-tool` is a privileged remote automation server. It cannot sandbox a user who has valid SSH credentials, so v2 focuses on secure defaults, explicit policy, auditability, and clear trust boundaries.

## Trust Boundaries

- The MCP client is a privileged operator once it can call this server.
- The local machine running the server can access SSH keys, agent sockets, policy files, and logs.
- Remote hosts enforce their own SSH, sudo, filesystem, package, and service permissions.
- HTTP transport is a remote attack surface and must be authenticated.

## v2 Defaults

- Host key verification is `strict`.
- Root SSH login is denied.
- Raw `proc_sudo` is denied.
- Destructive commands are denied by safety policy.
- Destructive filesystem operations are limited to configured prefixes.
- HTTP binds to `127.0.0.1`.
- Legacy SSE endpoints are disabled.
- Logs are redacted before serialization.

## Host Keys

Use `SSH_MCP_HOST_KEY_POLICY`:

- `strict`: verify against `known_hosts`.
- `accept-new`: process-local trust-on-first-use for development and labs.
- `insecure`: disables host-key verification and should not be used in production.

For high-assurance sessions, pass `expectedHostKeySha256` to `ssh_open_session`. This pins a specific SHA-256 fingerprint for that connection.

Deprecated boolean aliases are still accepted for v2 compatibility, but new deployments should use `hostKeyPolicy`.

## Policy Layer

All mutating or privilege-sensitive handlers call the central policy engine. Policy can restrict:

- hosts
- root login
- raw sudo
- command allow/deny regexes
- destructive command patterns
- path allow/deny prefixes
- destructive filesystem operations

Use `policyMode: "explain"` to get a policy verdict without executing. This is the recommended AI-client pattern before configuration changes, deletes, sudo, package removal, service restart/stop, transfers, and tunnels.

## Audit And Observability

The server exposes:

- `mcp-ssh-tool://policy/effective`
- `mcp-ssh-tool://audit/recent`
- `mcp-ssh-tool://metrics/json`
- `mcp-ssh-tool://metrics/prometheus`

Metrics include sessions, command timing/failures, file bytes, transfer bytes, tunnel lifecycle, auth failures, and policy denials. Logs redact secrets such as passwords, private keys, passphrases, tokens, authorization headers, and agent paths.

## Recommended Production Posture

- Run stdio for local desktop use.
- Use Streamable HTTP only behind bearer auth and origin validation.
- Keep HTTP on loopback behind an authenticated reverse proxy whenever possible.
- Store policy in `SSH_MCP_POLICY_FILE`.
- Keep `allowRawSudo=false`; prefer `ensure_*` tools.
- Require non-root SSH users and grant narrow sudo rules on the host.
- Pin host fingerprints for sensitive hosts.
- Export JSON logs and Prometheus metrics to a secured destination.
- Review `mcp-ssh-tool://audit/recent` during incident response.
