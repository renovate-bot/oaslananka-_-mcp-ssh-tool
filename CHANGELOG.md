# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.5] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Tool names now use underscore format (`ssh_open_session`) instead of dot-notation (`ssh.openSession`) to comply with MCP protocol specification. Old names still work via aliases for backward compatibility.
- Session cleanup interval reduced from 60s to 10s for better resource management
- Added proper `destroy()` method to SessionManager for clean shutdown

### Security

- **DSA key support removed**: DSA keys are deprecated (disabled by default since OpenSSH 8.8) and should not be used
- **Command injection protection**: Added package name validation in `ensurePackage()` to prevent shell injection attacks

### Changed

- TOOL_ALIASES now maps old dot-notation names to new underscore names (backwards compatible)
