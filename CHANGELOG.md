## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-04

### Security

- Hardened transfer path authorization so MCP-server-host local file reads and writes are checked against separate local transfer policy prefixes.
- Hardened path deny-prefix checks with canonical normalization and segment-boundary matching.
- Hardened HTTP bearer authentication by using fixed-length constant-time token comparison.

### Changed

- `file_upload` and `file_download` local paths are now limited by `localPathAllowPrefixes`, which defaults to the OS temp directory. Set `SSH_MCP_LOCAL_PATH_ALLOW_PREFIXES` or the policy-file field when transfers need another local workspace.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Org-only hardening workflows with merge queue support, branch hygiene reporting, CycloneDX SBOM artifacts, test-result publishing, and stricter security scanning.
- Doppler-first secret inventory and verification scripts so release and coverage secrets are injected at runtime instead of stored as individual GitHub secrets.
- Local parity tooling with `Taskfile.yml`, pre-commit configuration, tracked `.githooks`, and a dry-run repository cleanup helper.
- MCP Registry publication in the trusted release path after npm publication.

### Changed

- Replaced personal-repo mirroring with organization pull/sync automation and guarded every GitHub Actions job to run only in `oaslananka-lab/mcp-ssh-tool`.
- Modernized the trusted publish path with Node 24-compatible actions, artifact attestations, npm provenance, GitHub Release creation, and org-to-canonical release metadata mirroring.
- Reworked security jobs to remove Node 20-deprecated action paths by running Gitleaks, Trivy, and OSV through pinned CLI containers where needed.
- Refreshed dependency automation, issue forms, README badges, operational runbooks, branch protection guidance, release docs, troubleshooting, threat model, and API stability documentation.

### Security

- Added fail-closed CodeQL, Gitleaks, Trivy, Hadolint, Zizmor, OSV, dependency review, and Scorecard coverage for the organization repository.
- Hardened Docker images to run as the non-root `node` user after build.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Streamable HTTP transport with stdio as the default local transport and legacy SSE gated behind an explicit compatibility switch.
- Central policy engine for host, command, path, root-login, sudo, destructive command, and destructive filesystem controls.
- `hostKeyPolicy`, `expectedHostKeySha256`, and per-session `policyMode` support for safer session creation and explain-mode workflows.
- Stable tool metadata, annotations, output schemas, structured content, curated MCP prompts, and additional resources for policy, audit, and support matrix visibility.
- CI/CD topology for personal source repository plus organization-owned automated validation, security scanning, trusted npm publishing, and Doppler-backed runtime secrets.
- GitLab manual validation pipeline and manual source mirroring workflow for the GitHub organization CI/CD repository.

### Changed

- Raised the runtime floor to Node.js `>=22.14.0` and aligned validation around Node 22/24 with Node 26 canary coverage.
- Default security posture is now strict host-key verification, no root SSH login, raw sudo denied, destructive operations policy-gated, and remote HTTP bound to loopback.
- File operations now enforce size limits and use SFTP-first behavior with safer portability fallbacks.
- Tunnels now have real lifecycle accounting and close semantics.
- Azure Pipelines are manual-only validation/release-control backups; automatic CI/CD now runs in the `oaslananka-lab` GitHub organization mirror.
- README, security, architecture, migration, enterprise, troubleshooting, and CI/CD documentation were updated for v2 behavior.

### Security

- Added machine-readable policy denials and standardized error codes including `EPOLICY`, `EHOSTKEY`, `ELIMIT`, and `EUNSUPPORTED`.
- Improved auditability, metrics, redacted structured logging, and safer publish provenance flow.
- Moved personal-repository mirror and emergency publish secrets behind Doppler runtime fetches.

### Breaking

- v2 secure defaults can deny workflows that previously relied on insecure host-key behavior, root login, raw sudo, or unrestricted destructive operations.
- Remote HTTP usage should migrate to Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`; legacy SSE is compatibility-only.
- Node.js versions below `22.14.0` are no longer supported.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- Generic MCP client guidance for Claude Desktop, Antigravity, and other stdio-compatible MCP tools
- INSTALL guide examples for both `servers` and `mcpServers` style client configurations

### Changed

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: `scripts/setup-chatgpt.js` ESM/CJS uyumsuzluğu düzeltildi
- **CRITICAL**: `detect.ts` RHEL sürüm tespiti regex düzeltildi
- **CRITICAL**: `patch_apply` tool alan adı uyumsuzluğu (`patch` → `diff`) düzeltildi
- **CRITICAL**: `ensure_package` ve `ensure_lines_in_file` araçlarına `absent` state eklendi
- `commander` v14 için Node.js engine gereksinimleri güncellendi (`>=20`)
- `STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING` env değişkeni artık `session.ts` tarafından okunuyor
- E2E testlerdeki `FileStatInfo.isFile` ve `DirListResult` tip hataları düzeltildi
- `fs-tools.ts` SFTP stat tip tespiti güvenli hale getirildi

### Added

- `absent` state desteği: `ensure_package` artık paket kaldırabilir
- `absent` state desteği: `ensure_lines_in_file` artık satır silebilir
- `ensure_service` tool'una `restarted` state eklendi
- `get_metrics` tool'u ile sunucu performans metrikleri sorgulanabilir

## [1.2.5] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Tool names now use underscore format (`ssh_open_session`) instead of dot-notation (`ssh.openSession`) to comply with MCP protocol specification. Old names still work via aliases for backward compatibility.
- Session cleanup interval reduced from 60s to 10s for better resource management
- Added proper `destroy()` method to SessionManager for clean shutdown

### Security

- **DSA key support removed**: DSA keys are deprecated (disabled by default since OpenSSH 8.8) and should not be used
- **Command injection protection**: Added package name validation in `ensurePackage()` to prevent shell injection attacks

### Changed

- TOOL_ALIASES now maps old dot-notation names to new underscore names (backwards compatible)
